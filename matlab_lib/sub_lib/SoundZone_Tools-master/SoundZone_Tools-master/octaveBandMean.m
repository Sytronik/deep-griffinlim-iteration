function [ magSpect_oct, freqVec_oct ] = octaveBandMean( magSpect, freqVec, octSpace, centerFreq )
% Given a magnitude spectrum this function will calculate the average (single, third, nth) octave band magnitude
% 
% Syntax:	[ MAGSPECT_OCT, FREQVEC_OCT ] = OCTAVEBANDMEAN( MAGSPECT, FREQVEC, OCTSPACE, CENTERFREQ )
% 
% Inputs: 
% 	magSpect - An arbitrary magnitude spectrum as a vector
% 	freqVec - The corresponding frequencies for each magnitude value
% 	octSpace - A single value between 0 and 1 specifying the octave spacing
% 	centerFreq - The center frequency for the octave band
% 
% Outputs: 
% 	magSpect_oct - The magnitude spectrum averaged per octave band
% 	freqVec_oct - The corresponding frequencies for the output magnitude vector

Sound Zone Tools is a collection of auxiliary MATLAB tools for soundfield reproduction and other signal processing tasks. The tools have been written by myself or collected from other open sources. If a file is missing and there is no download link in the parent file's header, please open an issue to request the link.

Don't forget to give appropriate reference to the code used, author details are usually found in the file's header.
Enjoy!

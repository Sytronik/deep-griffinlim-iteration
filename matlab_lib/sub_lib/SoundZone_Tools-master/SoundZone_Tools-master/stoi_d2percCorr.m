function [stoi_PercCorr] = stoi_d2percCorr(stoi_d)
% Converts the stoi measure, d, to percent words correct unit
% 
% Syntax:	[stoi_PercCorr] = stoi_d2percCorr(stoi_d) 
% 
% Inputs: 
% 	stoi_d - The STOI measure in the raw units
% 
% Outputs: 
% 	stoi_PercCorr - The corressponding STOI value in Percent of Words
% 	Correct as defined for the IEEE English Library

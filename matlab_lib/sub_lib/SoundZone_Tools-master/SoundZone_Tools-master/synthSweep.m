% Synthesize a logarithmic sine sweep
%   [sweep invsweepfft sweepRate] = SYNTHSWEEP(T,FS,f1,f2,tail,AsdB) 
%   generates a logarithmic sine sweep that starts at frequency f1 (Hz),
%   stops at frequency f2 (Hz) and duration T (sec) at sample rate FS (Hz).
%    
%   usePlots indicates whether to show frequency characteristics of the
%   sweep, and the optional AsdB is an amplitude suppression value in
%   decibels to avoid clipping

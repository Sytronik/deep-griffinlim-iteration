function RelFiles = buildReleaseZIP( WorkingDir, zipFileName, MainFile, RelFiles, RuntimeDependencies )
% Creates a ZIP file of all release dependencies for a main file
% 
% Syntax:	BUILDRELEASEZIP( WORKINGDIR, ZIPFILENAME, MAINFILE, RUNTIMEDEPENDENCIES )
% 
% Inputs: 
% 	WorkingDir          - The working directory of the project to release.
% 	zipFileName         - The name the final ZIP file.
% 	MainFile            - The path to the file for which to determine the
%                         dependencies and consequently build the release
%                         ZIP.
%   RelFiles            - A list of files to release (the main file's 
%                         dependencies are added to this list).
% 	RuntimeDependencies - If true, dependencies are found during a profiled
%                         runtime.
% 
% Outputs: 
% 	RelFiles            - The final list of released files.
% 
% Example: 
%     wrkdir = 'C:\myProject\';
%     zipFname = 'myProject_release';
%     mainFile = 'C:\myProject\examples\fullyfledgedexample.m';
%     buildReleaseZIP( wrkdir, zipFname, mainFile, {}, true )

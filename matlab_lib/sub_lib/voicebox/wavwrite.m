function wavwrite(y,fs,n,fn)
%WAVREAD  Legacy MATLAB function to write .WAV file (Y,Fs,N,FILENAME)
% wavwrite writes data to 8-, 16-, 24-, and 32-bit .wav files.
%
% Usage:
% wavwrite(y,'filename')        writes the data stored in the variable y to a WAVE file called filename.
%                               The data has a sample rate of 8000 Hz and is assumed to be 16-bit.
%                               Each column of the data represents a separate channel.
%                               Therefore, stereo data should be specified as a matrix with two columns.
%                               Amplitude values outside the range [-1,+1] are clipped prior to writing.
% wavwrite(y,Fs,'filename')     writes the data stored in the variable y to a WAVE file called filename.
%                               The data has a sample rate of Fs Hz and is assumed to be 16-bit.
%                               Amplitude values outside the range [-1,+1] are clipped prior to writing.
% wavwrite(y,Fs,N,'filename')   writes the data stored in the variable y to a WAVE file called filename.
%                               The data has a sample rate of Fs Hz and is N-bit, where N is 8, 16, 24, or 32.
%                               For N < 32, amplitude values outside the range [-1,+1] are clipped.
% Note:    8-, 16-, and 24-bit files are type 1 integer pulse code modulation (PCM). 32-bit files are written as type 3 normalized floating point.

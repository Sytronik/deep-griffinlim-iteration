function [y,s]=gammalns(x)
% GAMMALNS Log of Gamma(x) for positive or negative real x [y,s]=(x)
%
%  Inputs: x      real matrix of input values
%
% Outputs: y      log(gamma(x)) or, if s is present, log(abs(gamma(x))) 
%          s      sign(gamma(x))
%
% If s is not specified then y will b complex if gamma(x) is negative (i.e. if floor(x) is negative and odd).
% Uses gamma(x) = pi/gamma(1-z)/sin(pi*z) which is 5.5.3 from [1]

function axisenlarge(f,h)
%AXISENLARGE - enlarge the axes of a figure (f,h)
%
% Usage:  (1) axisenlarge(1.05)    % enlarge axes by 5% in each direction
%         (2) axisenlarge(-1.05)   % shrink to fit content before enlarging
%
% Inputs:
%    f      enlarge axis by a factor f relative to current size or
%           by -f relative to the graph content. For separate factors
%           in each direction use [fx fy fz] or [fleft fright fbottom ftop fdown fup] 
%    h      axis handle [default = gca]

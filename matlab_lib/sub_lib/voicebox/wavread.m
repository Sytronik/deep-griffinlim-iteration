function [y,fs,bits]=wavread(fn,n)
%WAVREAD  Legacy MATLAB function to read .WAV file [Y,FS,BITS]=(FILENAME,NMAX)
% wavread supports multichannel data, with up to 32 bits per sample, and supports reading 24- and 32-bit .wav files.
%
% Usage:
% y = wavread('filename')               loads a WAVE file specified by the string filename, returning
%                                       the sampled data in y. The .wav extension is appended if no
%                                       extension is given. Amplitude values are in the range [-1,+1].
% [y,Fs,bits] = wavread('filename')     returns the sample rate (Fs) in Hertz and the number of bits
%                                       per sample (bits) used to encode the data in the file.
% [...] = wavread('filename',N)         returns only the first N samples from each channel in the file.
% [...] = wavread('filename',[N1 N2])   returns only samples N1 through N2 from each channel in the file.
% siz = wavread('filename','size')      returns the size of the audio data contained in the file in place
%                                       of the actual audio data, returning the vector siz = [samples channels].
